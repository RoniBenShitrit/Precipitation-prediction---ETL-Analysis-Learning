# NOAA-Precipitation-prediction
The objective of this project is to predict the average monthly precipitation in Germany and Sweden. 
This project consists of 3 main parts:
1. ETL - Streaming data with Kafka, transforming it with PySpark and storing it in MSSQL Database.
2. Data Analysis - Using our stored data to preform evalutations, feature selection and feature engineering on our data in preparation of fitting a model to it.
3. precipitation prediction (Learning) - Fitting several machine learning models to our data and obtaining final predictions.
Additionally, as a bonus task, we attempted to find evidence of global warming using ML models.
